-- Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

-- This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions 
-- that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. 
-- For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness 
-- of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be 
-- graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and 
-- comments where necessary.

-- In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences 
-- and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will 
-- be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first 
-- part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper 
-- formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

-- For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions 
-- you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where 
-- indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able 
-- to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) 
-- to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout 
-- application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
-- In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for 
-- you reviewer.

-- 3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis 
-- you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

-- Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment 
-- analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
-- predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user 
-- will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to 
-- be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, 
-- in-line, to all of the following:
	
-- i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
        
		Illustrating the correlation between review stars with the review couunts.
         
-- ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
        
		Two tables of business and reviews have been used for the analysis. The two aforementioned tables were being joined 
		based on the id of the business and review. Then the results, which is the review counts of the business, has 
		been sorted in a descending order. 
		The logic behind choosing the two tables of data for the analysis is that number reviews and stars that the business 
		earned from the reviewers. Star depend on the type of service and how well they provide that specific service.
		We can infer that there is a correlation between the number of stars and the review counts. However the correlation is not 
		strong, which could be related scientifically to the behavioral models of the customers and how was their
		experience of the business.
